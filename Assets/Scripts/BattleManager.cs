    // I want to include the player's stats as well. Then through here handle player's inputs for the battle.
    // For the enemies, when the turn begins they will follow an attack pattern based on their individual functions.
    // This is the toughest part, but I need to determine turn order based on agility and then somehow thread the player and enemy into each other's functions to receive their damage.
